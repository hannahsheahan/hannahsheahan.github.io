### I research how humans and neural networks learn stuff.


Research
------

### Learning relational structure
Psychologists use the term 'structure learning' to describe how humans learn invariances over relational patterns in data. For example, the concept we call *magnitude* describes a structure that relates stimuli to each other along a single dimension. Abstracting the relationships between stimuli across contexts permits new inferences, such as knowing that both cheetahs and space rockets move 'fast', even though animals and vehicles belong in different semantic categories, do not look alike and move at different absolute speeds. How do humans and neural networks learn abstract knowledge of simple relational structures like magnitude? How does action impact or afford the learning of spatial or more abstract relations?

### Learning theory
What principles underlie learning in neural network models and how can we understand them? What makes some things easy to learn and other things hard? Can we predict learning dynamics? Can these tools enable us to predict the geometry of neural representations in animals performing different tasks?

### Motor learning & control
How do we humans learn and adapt our movements as we experience the world? And how do we learn and parcellate lots of different motor skills, without overwriting others?


Engineering
------

I studied engineering as an undergraduate and it imprinted on me. Alongside research, I enjoy building [environments](https://hannahsheahan.github.io/projects/) in Unity, programming [robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeJP9AW-KNg) and [automating things](https://github.com/hannahsheahan).
