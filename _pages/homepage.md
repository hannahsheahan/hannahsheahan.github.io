I am a Research Engineer at [Google DeepMind](http://deepmind.com). I work on human-AI interaction in large language models. 


Before switching to AI research, I did my PhD at The University of Cambridge in the [Computational \& Biological Learning Lab](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/),
supervised by [Daniel Wolpert](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YM8BRlUAAAAJ&hl=en), and a postdoc at The University of Oxford with [Chris Summerfield](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ymlcN9AAAAAJ&hl=en).

My PhD and postdoc were in cognitive science. I was interested in embodied learning, generalisation and the effects of context and task structure on learning in humans (and later, neural networks).
I also hold a BEng (hons) in engineering from the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html) in NZ.
